disp('Hello players, welcome to Blackjack')

%% Player input initialization
% Need inputs, how many player and initial $
numPlayers=input('Enter numbers of palyers:')

% Need larger loop for how long to play
% Initialize player variables

%% Game initialization
myDeck=innitDeck();

%% Main loop
while(number of players>0 or players decide to end)

% take initial bets

%Shuffle deck
playingDeck=shuffleDeck(myDeck);

% create loop for dealing cards
% display information in command window, needs to be for players and dealer
% runs once for each player and gives each player an empty hand-NO CARDS YET
for i=1:numPlayers
  players(i).hand=[]


% Dealing with first two cards
for i=1:numPlayers
  [player(i),deck]=dealCard(player(i),deck);
  [player(i),deck]=dealCard(player(i),deck);
% For two times because Blackjack starts with two cards
% dealCard means
player.Hand(i+1)=deck(i);
deck(i)=[];

% hit/stand logic, use functions from below

end

%% my local functions
function shuffledDeck=shuffleDeck(myDeck)

end

function myDeck=innitDeck()
%create a loop for each suit
% Should my deck be: array, tables, structures
% Align card values, suits
end

function [updatedPlayer,updatedDeck]=dealCards(shuffledDeck, player)
% think about player variable
% update player hand, calculate player hand value
% if hand>21 and contains an Ace -> make the Ace Value=1
% use the evaluate Hand function here
% update shuffledDeck to remove cards delt shuffledDeck(1)=[];
end

% need logic to determine if player wins against dealer
end

% need logic here to determine if the dealer should hit or stand
% while loop, dealer hand<17 dealer needs to hit
